# Pert-project-management
pure pythonic way to implement PERT&amp;cpm project management system .

Pay attention: 
the tasks is on the nodes, and the graph is manged by a dictonary. 

In this program you can : 
1. add or remove nodes
2. add multiply edged from each node
3. find earliest time to start /finish each task.
4. find if your graph is cyclic.
5. find slack time for ALL tasks -(if there are cycles in your graph you cant calculate slack time)


Note: see file project.py and in the end of it you can see output & input examples.
